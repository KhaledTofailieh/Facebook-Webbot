<h2><left>- Hello, This Notebook Contains Facebook Web-bot. </left></h2>
<h3><left>- I've developed this bot for fething posts from pages on Facebook. </left></h3>
<h3><left>- Facebook's policy block all bots do that, so I used Selenium Library as a trick. </left></h3>
<h3><left>- Selenium Library in python make website policy believe that the request sender is human not bot. </left></h3>
<h3><left>- My trick successed and I get about 20,000 post from varied pages on Facebook. </left></h3>
<h3><left>- I put some of fetched posts in 'Crawled-data' Folder. </left></h3>
